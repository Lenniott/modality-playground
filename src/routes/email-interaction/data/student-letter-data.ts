  introduction: "Dear [Educator's Name],\n\nI hope you are well. I am writing to you because I am struggling with my schoolwork and need your help.",
  issues: "My family is going through a tough time financially. My parents both work long hours, and I have to take care of my younger siblings and help out around the house. This leaves me with very little time and a quiet place to study. We don't have reliable internet at home, and I often have to go to the library to use the computers there. However, the library closes early, and I can't always make it due to my work schedule.",
  request: "I really want to do well in your class, but I'm finding it hard to keep up with the assignments and the readings. I feel overwhelmed and worried that I will fall behind. I am reaching out to see if there are any ways you might be able to help me manage my schoolwork better or any resources you could recommend that might help with my situation.",
  closing: "Thank you for taking the time to read my email. I appreciate any support you can offer.\n\nBest regards,\n[Student's Name]"
